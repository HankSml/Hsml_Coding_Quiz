# Hsml_Coding_Quiz
This website is a timed quiz with coding questions, which stores your high score locally for comparison with peers. There are currently 5 questions, but more can easily be added. The quiz can also be retaken as many times as the user would like without reloading the page, and each score will be recorded (even if it is not the user's high score). <br />
